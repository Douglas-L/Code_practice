#  Visualizing Sneaker Sales

This is a data set from the StockX website, a marketplace for streetwear. It consists of a random sample of all Off-White x Nike and Yeezy 350 sales from between 9/1/2017 (the month that Off-White first debuted “The Ten” collection) and the present. I perform some exploratory data analysis and create a couple of features before doing further visualizations in Tableau.
