In this notebook, I take a dataset originally intended for Excel and do the same analysis more simply using pandas. I also practice using a chi squared test of independence between two categorical variables with Scipy.

The data and problem is found at https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AppliedDataAnalysis/blob/master/ChallengeLab.pdf.
